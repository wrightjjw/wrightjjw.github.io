There were a lot of interesting projects, but one team in particular was struggling with their project. Seemed like they could use another team member, so I ended up joining. I was the only one with prior programming experience, so I was able to help the team a lot. Immediately, I was able to help with rendering tetriminos and the logic behind stacking them, but the rest of the team definitely began pulling their weight as the days went on. I tended to work more on game logic than anything else.

Sure, in the beginning the group had no grasp on how even to proceed, but every team member put in a lot of work to make the best product they could. We had a plan and we followed it; loading in our blood, sweat, tears, and passion. To this day, I am still very proud of this project. And it still runs on modern Python 3 and Pygame!
