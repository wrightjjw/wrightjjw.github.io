There were a lot of interesting projects, but one team in particular was struggling with their project. Seemed like they could use another team member, so I ended up joining. I was the only one with prior programming experience, so I was able to help the team a lot. Immediately, I was able to help with rendering tetriminos and the logic behind stacking them, but the rest of the team definitely began pulling their weight as the days went on.

Sure, in the beginning the group had no grasp on how even to proceed, but every team member put in a lot of work to make the best product they could. We had a plan and we followed it; loading in our blood, sweat, tears, and passion. To this day, I am still very proud of this project.
