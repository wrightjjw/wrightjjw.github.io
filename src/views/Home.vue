    <h1>Josh's Website!</h1>
    <p>
        I am Josh Wright, sometimes known as wrightjjw or Weirdcko, and this is my website!
        I'm currently rewriting it in <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue</a>.
        You can check out the source on <a href="https://github.com/wrightjjw/wrightjjw.github.io">GitHub</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
        You can use the navigator at the top of the page to see an overview of my computer science projects,
        but I'm still adding information so you might get a better overview by looking at
        <a href="https://github.com/wrightjjw">my GitHub profile</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm also planning on adding information related to more of my hobbies as they develop,
        like music production and competitive Pok√©mon VGC.
